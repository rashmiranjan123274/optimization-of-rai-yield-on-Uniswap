Hello everyone we hope all you are good. Now let's move to our main focus how we can optimize Rai yield on Uniswap V3.
First thing we need to clear about yield farming also known as yield or liquidity harvesting,involves lending crypto currency.In return,we get interest or reward of defi token and sometimes fees, but they're less significant than the practice of supplementing interest with handouts of units of a new cryptocurrency. The real payoff comes if that coin appreciates rapidly.

Reflexer is a platform where anyone can use their crypto collateral to mint stablecoins. Stablecoins, as opposed to fiat coins, are not pegged to anything, very similar to how the US Dollar is not pegged and it is still considered stable. In this platform we gonna to stake or yield Rai token because RAI is one of the first real stablecoins which are not pegged to any fiat currency.

After reaching out reflexer lab platform here we are going to get much more reward by staking Rai with best pools with Apr flux reward token.

# Yield Rai 

In the first method we need to connect our metamask wallet of ETH blockchain have funds like rai or dai. After successful connection there is showing a lots of pool of different defi token but we need to find out the best pool for us with our defi token which we hold in our wallet.
